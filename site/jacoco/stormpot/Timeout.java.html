/**
 * A Timeout represents the maximum amount of time a caller is willing to wait
 * for a blocking operation to complete.
 *
 * Timeouts are independent of their units, so two timeouts of equivalent
 * duration but constructed in different units, will be equal to each other and
 * work exactly the same.
 *
 * Timeouts are also independent of &quot;calendar time&quot; in the sense that they
 * represent and work as a duration of absolute time. In other words, timeouts
 * do not grow or shrink with passing leap seconds or daylight savings time
 * adjustments.
