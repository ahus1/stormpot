== The Stormpot Release Process

This is not really documentation, but rather an "internal" document detailing the release process, so that I don't forget any steps.

* [ ] Create a card tracking the release, based on this checklist.
* [ ] Fix all the issues
* [ ] Update & review the javadoc & documentation
* [ ] Make sure `gpg` command is GPG version 2
* [ ] Make sure `settings.xml` has an `ossrh` server with correct username and password
* [ ] Run `mvn clean deploy -P release` on _SNAPSHOT_ version to test process
* [ ] Change `pom.xml` to the desired version
* [ ] Run `mvn clean deploy -P release`
* [ ] When successful, commit changes, tag commit, push --tags
* [ ] Run `./docupdate.sh` and push updated web site
* [ ] Announce on mailing list & write blog post
